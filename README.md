# Tranformer model using PyTorch
### Overview
This project presents a decoder-only transformer architecture trained on Shakespeare dataset. The goal was to develop a model capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text in the style of William Shakespeare. The transformer, implemented from scratch, showcases my expertise in natural language processing and transformer architectures.
